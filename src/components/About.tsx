            <h2>About Homeforia</h2>

            <p>
                Homeforia was born from a desire to live surrounded by objects that truly
                feel like home. Inspired by global craftsmanship and human connection,
                we create furniture and décor rooted in sustainability, ethics, and artisan work.
            </p>

            <p>
                Home is our sanctuary — a place where comfort, texture, light, and design
                shape how we feel every day. That belief defines everything we create.
            </p>

            <p>
                At Homeforia, comfort living goes beyond design. We work with eco-friendly
                materials and skilled artisans to craft meaningful pieces that enrich
                everyday life.
